    <p id="C++">
            C++ (pronounced /ˌsiːˌplʌsˈplʌs/ "cee plus plus") is a general-purpose programming language. 
            It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features,
            while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
            
            It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded,
            resource-constrained and large systems,
            with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights.
            [6] C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts,
            with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,
            [6] including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search or SQL servers),
            and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).
            [7] C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms.
            Many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, Microsoft,
            Intel, and IBM.
        
            C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), 
            with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017 (informally known as C++17).
            [8] The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998,
            which was then amended by the C++03,
            C++11 and C++14 standards. The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library.
            Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979, 
            as an extension of the C language as he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C,
            which also provided high-level features for program organization. C++20 is the next planned standard thereafter.

    <p id="PHP">
            PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language.
            Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994,
            [3] the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.
            [4] PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,
            [3] but it now stands for the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor[5]
            
            PHP code may be embedded into HTML code, or it can be used in combination with various web template systems,
            web content management systems, and web frameworks.
            PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, 
            which may be any type of data, including images, with the generated web page. PHP code may also be executed with a command-line interface (CLI) and can be used to implement standalone graphical applications.[6]
            
            The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License.
            PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every 
            operating system and platform,
            free of charge.[7]
            
            The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014,
            leaving the canonical PHP interpreter as a de facto standard. Since 2014 work has
            gone on to create a formal PHP specification.[8]
            
            During the 2010s there have been increased efforts towards standardisation and code sharing in PHP applications
            by projects such as PHP-FIG in the form of PSR-initiatives as well as Composer dependency manager and the
            Packagist repository. PHP hosts a diverse array of web frameworks requiring framework-specific knowledge,
            with Laravel recently emerging as a popular option by incorporating ideas made popular from other
             competing non-PHP web frameworks,

                Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. 
                Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, 
                Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, 
                and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code,
                [25][26] notably using significant whitespace.
                It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.[27]
                    
                    Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.
                    It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented,
                    imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library.
                    [28]
                    

                Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.
                CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is open source software[29]
                and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations
                . CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.

                <P id="java">Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, 
                class-based, object-oriented,[15] and specifically designed to have as few implementation
                dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere"
                    (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without t
                he need for recompilation.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run
                on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of
                the most popular programming languages in use,[18][19][20][21] particularly for client-server web 
                applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[22] Java was originally developed by James Gosling 
                at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as
                a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from
                C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
